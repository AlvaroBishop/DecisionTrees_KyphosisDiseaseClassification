# Amazon Alexa Review Ratings Classification

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a Random Forest model for the classification of Amazon Alexa customer reviews. By analyzing the textual content of reviews and associated star ratings, the goal is to gain insights into consumer sentiments and perform sentiment analysis on the data. Understanding customer sentiments can aid in product improvement, marketing strategies, and overall customer satisfaction.

## Data
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be found at Amazon Alexa Reviews. It comprises nearly 3000 customer reviews for various Amazon Alexa products, including Alexa Echo, Echo Dots, Alexa Firesticks, and more.

- Date of Review: The date when the review was posted.
- Product Variant: The specific variant of the Amazon Alexa product being reviewed.
- Feedback: Additional feedback or comments provided by the customers.

## Model
The classification model used in this project is based on the Random Forest algorithm. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes for classification problems.

## Project Goals
- Sentiment Analysis: Utilize the Random Forest model to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon Alexa customer reviews.
- Insights Discovery: Extract meaningful insights from the data to understand customer sentiments and preferences.
